watching the game with my legs closed just incase em,
Joe Hart is having a stormer tonight His brothers will be proud,
Pep Guardiolas reaction to Messi nutmegging Milner was ace,
Hes trying to hide it as best he can but I can hear it in his voice Gary Neville has just got an erection,
Gary Neville Its a poor penalty The worse type Not wrong there Gaz They are the bloody worst ones,
Sometimes you just need to hold your hands up when you are up against the best Messis first touch is out of this world,
Barca are toying with Man City like a bellend cat thats just found a little mouse,
Shame for going out but amazing team Joe Hart was brilliant,
90 minutes in 90 words CNNs quick rundown of in this gallery,
Joe Hart has had a good game to be fair Especially considering the defence in front of him are all on the Gazprom,
I have no idea why Zabaleta hasnt started this game Sagna is having an absolute nightmare Robbie Savage,
Messi undoubtedly stole the show but as the curtain falls take a bow Joe Hart,
Instead of booting people try and have an influence on the game Robbie Savage,
The ball does not lie,
I mean Gary Neville turning up at Camp Nou dressed like this is a little disrespectful no Shame,
